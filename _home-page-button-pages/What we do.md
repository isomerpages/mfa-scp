The SCP serves as a platform for Singapore to share knowledge, exchange ideas and network with foreign government officials on mansy issues of common interest such as climate change and digital economy.

We conduct short courses, workshops and study visits for foreign government officials in areas where Singapore has expertise in. We also offer a limited number of scholarships for select post-graduate courses Masters in public policy and international relations.
