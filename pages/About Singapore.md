Situated on the confluence of global trading routes, Singapore is a culturally diverse country which has historically served as a
meeting point between East and West. 

Today, it is an important international trading and financial hub for the Asia-Pacific region, with linkages to major markets in the region. It
is also the largest foreign direct investor in China and India and hosts a third of Asian headquartered Fortune 500 companies.

Singapore is also at the heart of global cutting-edge technological innovation in fields such as finance, biotechnology, urban
planning and transportation.

As a small and diverse city-state with limited natural resources, Singapore has had to devise innovative public policies to
foster a national identity and build up strong
public institutions.

ETAP participants to Singapore will get the opportunity to engage in conversations with renowned Singaporean policy practitioners
and academics to understand Singapore’s development experience. Additionally, they will get a perspective of regional developments,
