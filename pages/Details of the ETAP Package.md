The ETAP package established in 2013 as part of Singapore's ongoing commitment to support the capacity building and development needs of the Palestinian Authority.

As part of the ETAP, Palestinian government officials are offered sponsorships to participate in customised study visits to Singapore and capacity building courses under the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP). The ETAP also offers scholarships for promising young Palestinians to pursue their postgraduate studies at Singapore's internationally renowned universities.
