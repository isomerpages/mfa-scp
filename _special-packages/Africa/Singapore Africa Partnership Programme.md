### As a sign of Singapore's interest in our continued engagement of Africa and to commemorate the SCP's 30th anniversary, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced the Singapore-Africa Partnership Package (SAPP) during his official visit to Rwanda in June 2022. 
#### 
#### The three year SAPP, which runs from 2022 to 2025. offers up to:

1. Customised courses per year in Singapore in emerging areas such as Climate Change and Sustainability, and Digitalisation and Smart Cities
2. Priority places for African government officials in SCP courses
3. Post-graduate scholarships each year for senior African government officials to attend selected one-year programmes in LKYSPP and RSIS.
