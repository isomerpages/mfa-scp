Singapore benefited from the assistance from developed countries and international organisations in our early years of independence.

The advice that we received helped us to formulate and implement policies for Singapore that have helped us to grow and prosper.

Our government officers received training in many areas:
* manufacturing
* shipbuilding
* transportation and communications
* education
* healthcare
* public sector reform

The Singapore Cooperation Programme was formally established in 1992 to give back to the world. We focus on human resource development as we believe that human capital is the key to a country's sustainable development.
